<h2>a Tor network status <a href="protocol.html">protocol</a></h2>

<p>Onionoo is a web-based protocol to learn about currently running
Tor relays and bridges.  Onionoo itself was not designed as a service
for human beings&mdash;at least not directly.  Onionoo provides the
data for other applications and websites which in turn present Tor
network status information to humans.  The following Onionoo clients
are currently available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a> is a web
application to discover Tor relays. It provides useful
information on how relays are configured along with graphics about
their past.</li>
<li><a href="https://compass.torproject.org/">Compass</a>
is a Python script and website that extracts consensus weight
information of currently running relays and aggregates weights of
relays running in the same country or same autonomous system.</li>
<li><a href="http://tor2web.org/">Tor2web</a> is a web proxy to Tor
Hidden Services. It uses Onionoo to get the list of currently running
Tor Exits to detect if the client is a Tor user and if so redirect
them to the .onion address.</li>
<li><a href="https://globe.torproject.org/">Globe</a> is a web
application
that allows you to search for Tor relays and bridges. It gives you a
detailed overview of properties and configurations of a relay or
bridge.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://nos-oignons.net/Services/index.en.html">Nos
oignons</a> website uses Onionoo to visualize bandwidth histories of
their relays.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html">metrics
website</a> visualizes diversity of the Tor network using bubble
graphs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/woeisme/torchart">torchart</a> is a PHP
WordPress plugin which draws 3 day traffic charts using pChart currently
used for displaying metric charts on
<a href="http://icetor.is/wordpress/metrics/">icetor.is</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kloesing/challenger">challenger</a>
aggregates graph data from relays participating in
<a href="https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/">EFF's 2014 Tor Challenge</a>
to provide statistics like total bytes transferred.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.networksaremadeofstring.anonionooid">AnOnionooid</a>
is an Android app that helps find and explore Tor relays and bridges.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following library facilitates development of Onionoo clients:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/duk3luk3/onion-py">OnionPy</a> is a
comprehensive pure-Python (2.7+) Onionoo wrapper with caching
support.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developing Onionoo applications</h2>

<p>The project pages of the Onionoo clients listed above have further
information for contacting the authors and contributing ideas or code.
The authors will be happy to hear your thoughts!</p>

<p>You don't find your favorite Onionoo client above?  Want to
implement your own and tell us to add it to the list?  The Onionoo
clients above are backed by a web-based
<a href="protocol.html">protocol</a>, which
facilitates developing new applications displaying Tor status
information.  Here are a few ideas for new Onionoo clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tor controller extension: Extend
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en">Vidalia</a> and/or
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/arm.html.en">arm</a> to look up details for the bridge
that the user is running and display what pool the bridge is contained
in.</li>
<li>Social network site plugin: Add a plugin to the social network
site of your choice to show your friends what Tor relays and bridges
you're running and how that helps users around the world.</li>
<li>Desktop tray icon: Write a tray icon for your favorite desktop
environment that tells you when your relay or bridge is down and that
displays some basic usage statistics.</li>
<li>E-mail notification service: Improve our e-mail notification
service <a href="https://weather.torproject.org/">Weather</a> by
implementing its own relay search or extending it to report when a
bridge drops off the network.</li>
<li>Command-line tool: Implement a command-line tool that quickly
searches a relay or bridge and prints out some status information to
help debug problems.</li>
<li>(Insert your idea here.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Want to help with developing the Onionoo server that provides
Tor status data, or want to run your own Onionoo server instance?  The
Onionoo server is written in Java with a tiny portion of Java
Servlets.  Instructions for setting up the Onionoo server to fetch the
required data from the Tor servers is described in the INSTALL file in
the sources.  For more details see the
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/onionoo.git">source code</a> and
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&component=Onionoo">issue
tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Related projects</h2>

<p>TorStatus is the name of a nowadays
<a href="https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torstatus/trunk/">unmaintained</a>
website that displays Tor relay information similar to
<a href="http://atlas.torproject.org/">Atlas</a>.  There are still a
few <a href="http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/">TorStatus</a>
<a href="https://torstatus.rueckgr.at/">websites</a>
<a href="http://tns.hermetix.org/">running</a>.</p>

<p>There's another project from summer 2011 called TorStatus which is
a <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torstatus.git">rewrite</a> of
the original TorStatus in Python/Django.  Unfortunately, it's also
unmaintained.</p>

<p>Finally, there's the
<a href="https://consensus-health.torproject.org/">consensus-health
page</a> which has the primary purpose of indicating problems with
creating a network status consensus.  As a side-effect this page lists
all currently running relays and how the directory authorities voted
on them.</p>
