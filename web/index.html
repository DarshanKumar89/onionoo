<h3>What is Onionoo?</h3>
<p>Onionoo is a web-based protocol to learn about currently running Tor
relays and bridges.
Onionoo itself was not designed as a service for human beings&mdash;at
least not directly.
Onionoo provides the data for other applications and websites which in
turn present Tor network status information to humans.</p>
<br>
<h3>What Onionoo clients are available?</h3>
<p>There are currently two Onionoo clients in the making:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Android app:</b> An Android app will let you add your relays or
bridges to your favorites list and keeps you always informed whether they
are running or not.
<li><b>Tor network status website:</b> A JavaScript-only Tor network
status website will enable you to search for relays by nickname,
fingerprint, or IP address and sort and filter results by more criteria.
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned until these clients are available.  Until then, your only
chance to learn what Onionoo does is to start developing your own
client.</p>
<br>
<h3>How can I develop a new Onionoo client?</h3>
<!-- Add the following lines once there are actual clients available:
<p>You don't find your favorite Onionoo client?
Want to implement your own and tell us to add it to the list above!
Here are a few ideas:</p>-->
<p>Don't want to wait until the clients above are available?
Want to implement your own and tell us to add it to the list above?
Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Vidalia or arm extension:</b> Extend Vidalia and/or arm to look up
details for the bridge that the user is running and display what pool the
bridge is contained in.</li>
<li><b>Social network site plugin:</b> Add a plugin to the social network
site of your choice to show your friends what Tor relays and bridges
you're running and how that helps users around the world.</li>
<li><b>Desktop tray icon:</b> Write a tray icon for your favorite desktop
environment that tells you when your relay or bridge is down and that
displays some basic usage statistics.</li>
<li><b>E-mail notification service:</b> Improve our e-mail notification
service Weather by implementing its own relay search or extending it to
report when a bridge drops off the network.</li>
<li><b>Command-line tool:</b> Implement a command-line tool that quickly
searches a relay or bridge and prints out some status information to help
debug problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I help develop the Onionoo server or run my own?</h3>
<p>The Onionoo server is written in Java with a tiny portion of Java
Servlets.
The source code and issue tracker are available
<a href="https://github.com/kloesing/Onionoo">here</a>.
Any <a href="mailto:karsten.loesing@gmx.net">help</a> with the Onionoo
server code is much appreciated!</p>
<p>While it's not required for running or developing an Onionoo client,
anyone can run their own Onionoo server.
No special Tor developer privileges are required for that.
Instructions for setting up the Onionoo server to fetch the required data
from the Tor servers is described in the INSTALL file in the sources.</p>
