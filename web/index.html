<h3>Onionoo protocol overview</h3>
<p>The Onionoo service is designed as a RESTful web service.
Onionoo clients send HTTP GET requests to the Onionoo server which
responds with JSON-formatted replies.</p>
<p>Onionoo clients and their developers should follow a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Compression:</b> Clients should include an <i>"Accept-Encoding:
gzip"</i> header in their requests and handle gzip-compressed responses.
Only requests starting at a certain size will be compressed by the
server.</li>
<li><b>Caching:</b> Clients should make use of the <i>"Last-Modified"</i>
header of responses and include that timestamp in a
<i>"If-Modified-Since"</i> header of subsequent requests.</li>
<li><b>Protocol changes:</b> There are plenty of reasons why we may have
to change the protocol described here.
Clients should be able to handle all valid JSON responses, ignoring
unknown fields and not breaking horribly in case of missing fields.
Protocol changes will be announced here by writing deprecated API parts in
<b><font color="red">red</font></b> and new parts in
<b><font color="blue">blue</font></b>.
Deprecated parts will be removed one month after their announcement.
Let us <a href="mailto:karsten.loesing@gmx.net">know</a> that you're
developing a client, and we're going to inform you of upcoming protocol
changes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Onionoo API is described by resource types and available methods
below.</p>

<p>Each of the methods above can be parameterized to select only a subset

If multiple parameters are specified, they are combined using a logical
