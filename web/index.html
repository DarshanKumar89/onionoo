<h3>What is StatusTor?</h3>
<br>
<p>StatusTor is a web-based protocol to learn about currently running
Tor relays and bridges.
StatusTor itself was not designed as a service for human
beings&mdash;at least not directly.
StatusTor provides the data for other applications and websites which in
turn present Tor network status information to humans.</p>
<br>
<h3>What StatusTor clients are available?</h3>
<br>
<p>There are currently two StatusTor clients available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Android app:</b>The <u><font color="gray">Android app</font></u>
lets you add your relays or bridges to your favorites list and keeps you
always informed whether they are running or not.
<li><b>Tor network status website:</b> The
<u><font color="gray">JavaScript-only Tor network status
website</font></u> enables you to search for relays by nickname,
fingerprint, or IP address and sort and filter results by more criteria.
</ul>
<br>
<h3>How can I develop a new StatusTor client?</h3>
<br>
<p>You don't find your favorite StatusTor client?
Want to implement your own and tell us to add it to the list above!
Here are a few ideas:
<ul>
<li><b>Vidalia or arm extension:</b> Extend Vidalia and/or arm to look up
details for the bridge that the user is running and display what pool the
bridge is contained in.</li>
<li><b>Social network site plugin:</b> Add a plugin to Facebook, Google+,
or the social network site of your choice to show your friends what Tor
relays and bridges you're running and how that helps users around the
world.</li>
<li><b>Desktop tray icon:</b> Write a tray icon for your favorite desktop
environment that tells you when your relay or bridge is down and that
displays some basic usage statistics.</li>
<li><b>E-mail notification service:</b> Improve our e-mail notification
service Weather by implementing its own relay search or extending it to
report when a bridge drops off the network.</li>
<li><b>Command-line tool:</b> Implement a command-line tool that quickly
searches a relay or bridge and prints out some status information to help
debug problems.</li>
</ul>
