<h3>What is Onionoo?</h3>
<br>
<p>Onionoo is a web-based protocol to learn about currently running Tor
relays and bridges.
Onionoo itself was not designed as a service for human beings&mdash;at
least not directly.
Onionoo provides the data for other applications and websites which in
turn present Tor network status information to humans.</p>
<br>
<h3>What Onionoo clients are available?</h3>
<br>
<p>There are currently two Onionoo clients in the making:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Android app:</b>An Android app will let you add your relays or
bridges to your favorites list and keeps you always informed whether they
are running or not.
<li><b>Tor network status website:</b> A JavaScript-only Tor network
status website will enable you to search for relays by nickname,
fingerprint, or IP address and sort and filter results by more criteria.
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned until these clients are available.  Until then, your only
chance to learn what Onionoo does is to start developing your own client.
<br>
<h3>How can I develop a new Onionoo client?</h3>
<br>
<p>You don't find your favorite Onionoo client?
Want to implement your own and tell us to add it to the list above!
Here are a few ideas:
<ul>
<li><b>Vidalia or arm extension:</b> Extend Vidalia and/or arm to look up
details for the bridge that the user is running and display what pool the
bridge is contained in.</li>
<li><b>Social network site plugin:</b> Add a plugin to the social network
site of your choice to show your friends what Tor relays and bridges
you're running and how that helps users around the world.</li>
<li><b>Desktop tray icon:</b> Write a tray icon for your favorite desktop
environment that tells you when your relay or bridge is down and that
displays some basic usage statistics.</li>
<li><b>E-mail notification service:</b> Improve our e-mail notification
service Weather by implementing its own relay search or extending it to
report when a bridge drops off the network.</li>
<li><b>Command-line tool:</b> Implement a command-line tool that quickly
searches a relay or bridge and prints out some status information to help
debug problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I help develop the Onionoo server?</h3>
<br>
<p>The Onionoo server is written in Java with a tiny portion of Java
Servlets.
The source code is available
<a href="https://github.com/kloesing/Onionoo.git">here</a>.
Any <a href="mailto:karsten.loesing@gmx.net">help</a> with the Onionoo
server code is much appreciated!
