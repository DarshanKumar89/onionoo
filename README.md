# Onionoo

Onionoo is a web-based protocol to learn about currently running Tor
relays and bridges.  Onionoo itself was not designed as a service for
human beings---at least not directly.  Onionoo provides the data for other
applications and websites which in turn present Tor network status
information to humans.

Onionoo _users_ should head over to `https://onionoo.torproject.org/` to
learn more about using Onionoo.

Onionoo _service operators_ should read `INSTALL.md`.

Onionoo _contributors_ should start reading `CONTRIB.md` and, once it's
available, run `ant doc` and read the generated JavaDocs.
